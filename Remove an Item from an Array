// Time to practice removing items from an array. The spread operator can be used here as well. 
// Other useful JavaScript methods include slice() and concat().
// The reducer and action creator were modified to remove an item from an array based on the index of the item. 
// Finish writing the reducer so a new state array is returned with the item at the specific index removed.
