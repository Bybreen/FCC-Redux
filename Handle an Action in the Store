// The code editor has the previous example as well as the start of a reducer function for you. 
// Fill in the body of the reducer function so that if it receives an action of type 'LOGIN' 
// it returns a state object with login set to true. Otherwise, it returns the current state. 
// Note that the current state and the dispatched action are passed to the reducer, 
// so you can access the action's type directly with action.type.

const defaultState = {
  login: false
};

const reducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  // change code below this line
  if(action.type === 'LOGIN') {
  return {
    login: true 
    };
    }else{
  return state;
  }
  // change code above this line
};

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

const loginAction = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
};
